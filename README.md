# PokeMatch

PokeMatch is a blockchain nft game inspired by the popular 90's Nintendo game Pokemon.
The tokens inside the game are wide ranging from squirtle to jigglypuff, so be ready to dive into nostalgia!

## Problems Faced
* Getting familiar with Truffle suite and solidity
* connecting the react-app to the smart contract
* Getting the proper version of libraries 
* setting up the layout of the react-app

## How To Play

Simply connect your Metamask or any other web-wallet to the application and you are good to go!
Your objective is to match similar tokens to collect them.

This is a demo test for the memory matching game which I have planned to expand to multiple levels filled with unique nfts for kids and people to collect just like you would do with your pokemon trading cards.

## Technology used
* Truffle
* Metamask
* Solidity
* Git & Github
